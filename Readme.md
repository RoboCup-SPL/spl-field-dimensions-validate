# RoboCup SPL Field Dimensions Validator

This program is used to validate the `field_dimension.json` files used by the RoboCup SPL league in 2021.

Give `field-validate.py` a list of files on the commandline and it will check all files whether they follow the schema defined by the SPL rules.

This program needs Python 3 to run. No other libraries or dependencies are required.
